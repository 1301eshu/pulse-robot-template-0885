But after a long wait, You begin to wonder- could I have used a different approach? Could I have written a better e-mail? Or did I miss something to impress my targeted audience?</p>\n<p class=\"\">Getting a high opening rate from your e-mail campaign feels like a dreadful task. The fact is, on average, an ordinary person receives approximately 150 e-mails daily and, without even a second thought, deletes half of them. </p>\n<p class=\"\">To make your intended target open, read, and take intended action to your e-mail, you need to write persuasive e-mails.</p>\n<h2 class=\"\" style=\"font-size: 23px;\">5 Ways To Make Your E-mail Marketing Campaign (E-mails) More Persuasive</h2>\n<p class=\"\">The following suggestions will help you write enough convincing e-mails that will persuade your audience not only to make them open but also to engage them and make your e-mail campaign a success. </p>\n<h3 class=\"\" style=\"font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.5em;\">1) Make Clear Proposition Right In the Subject Line</h3>\n<p class=\"\">33% of e-mail recipients choose whether to open an e-mail depending solely on the subject line- <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/subject-line-stats-open-rates-slideshare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot</a>. On average, an individual spends around 11 seconds gandering over an e-mail to determine whether he will read to the end. If the subject line is pleasing to the recipient&#8217;s eyes, they will be propelled to open your e-mail, even if they do not know about your business. </p>\n<p class=\"\">Write a short, benefit-focused subject line. However, the research has proved that the length of subject lines doesn&#8217;t determine the open and click-through rates, but relevance does. Get to the heart of your motive right away. Look at these examples of catch e-mail headlines. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<p class=\"mod-reset\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U3l-9RqkNsyrghy7dTlMhPBFSx9XGEgcbdJZhp_Jy3lk3NaFgHDRMqOagWyDmlaUaQHKkX24eusEfsfvXgJlyGlXQZ0vqah6zQYCRwpPtmkOGDuGn0xZiKbpg-ygCZfOhl9TcKG2\" alt=\"\"></p>\n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"boldgrid-section\">\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-12\">\n<p class=\"\"><em>Image Source: Get Response</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"\" style=\"font-size: 19px;\">2. Give Your Audience A Reason to Read your E-mail</h3>\n<p class=\"\">While you may want to dive head-first into setting up an e-mail campaign and broadcast it, make sure you profoundly understand your audience. Know your audience&#8217;s:</p>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li>Pain-points</li>\n<li>Needs &amp; Goals</li>\n<li>Communication Style</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"\">And then create e-mail considering all these factors. Even though you are offering an excellent service or selling a great product, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to remind your subscribers why they need to use them and how great they are. More than you can imagine, sometimes just a simple explanation is all it takes them to accept your offer.</p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Compare the two examples:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li>&#8220;We are offering a new collection of winter running shoes.&#8221;  </li>\n<li>&#8220;We are offering a new collection of winter running shoes that will enable you to run comfortably even when it&#8217;s slippery and cold outside. </li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"\">The second example gives the customer a solution to their <a href=\"https://api.growthnatives.com/blogs/salesforce-cpq/sales-challenges-can-solve-with-salesforce-cpq/\">problem and shows them how you care about them</a>. This psychological trick will make them desire to make a purchase decision.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" style=\"font-size: 19px;\">3. Include A Social Proof </h3>\n<p class=\"\">For any e-mail campaign, social proof works wonders.  Social proof is also something that works across all stages of the buying cycle awareness, engagement, and purchase. When making a decision, clients like to get clues from people with the experience of the product. <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/social-proof-customer-acquisition-roi/291903/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">63%</a> of consumers accept that they&#8217;re more likely to buy from a site that shows product reviews &amp; product ratings. </p>\n<p class=\"\">Adding social proofs in e-mails helps in boosting the <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://api.growthnatives.com/b2b-website-conversion-rate-optimization/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"conversion rate &amp; ROI (opens in a new tab)\">conversion rate &amp; ROI</a> while lowering the acquisition cost. Here is what type of social proof you can go for:</p>\n<ol class=\"\">\n<li>Customer testimonials</li>\n<li>Customer or usage numbers</li>\n<li>Awards &amp; Recognition (Your business has received)</li>\n<li>Product Review &amp; Ratings (By Customers)</li>\n<li>Direct Customer Feedback (e-mail, chat messages, photos or videos)</li>\n<li>Press Mentions ( by popular news sites or industry publications)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"\" style=\"font-size: 19px;\">4. Use Curiosity Gaps in your E-mail Marketing Campaigns</h3>\n<p class=\"\">Creating a curiosity gap means you&#8217;re teasing your reader by providing a little hint of what&#8217;s to come while concealing most of the information. The curiosity gap is an attempt to compel people to click on your e-mail, Ad, or blog post they see on Twitter.</p>\n<p class=\"\">This works in a way where the gap in knowledge encourages the receiver to click and open the mail to read what&#8217;s explained inside. </p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Example1:</strong> &#8220;* Don&#8217;t Open This E-mail*&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Example2:</strong> &#8220;Is this the hottest career in marketing?&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Example3:</strong> &#8220;Are these the best SKINCARE products?&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"\">That&#8217;s why businesses hire proficient writers to craft them. Nevertheless, they don&#8217;t work as effectively as your clients&#8217; imagination.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" style=\"font-size: 19px;\">5. Plan &amp; Schedule Your E-mail Campaign </h3>\n<p class=\"\">The time you send e-mails really matters. Your timing for emails should be dependent upon the time your audience mostly comes online. It also depends upon when they are most likely to engage. Example &#8211; If you are targeting stay home moms the ideal time would be between 10 AM to 12 PM, when they are most likely to be free.</p>\n<p class=\"\">An Experian <a href=\"http://www.experian.com/assets/cheetahmail/white-papers/email-marketing-quarterly-benchmark-study-q4-2012.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">e-mail marketing campaign benchmark study</a> (across all industries) says</p>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li>Mostly the people access the internet and are surprisingly active in late-night hours.</li>\n<li>On average, 21.7% of unique open rates recorded from 8 pm to 11:59 pm.</li>\n<li>17.6 percent of unique open rates recorded from 12 am to 4 am. Surprisingly, these late-night groups are more likely to click through, with click-through rates of 4.2% and 3.2 percent, respectively. </li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"\">The key to success is often experimentation with your time to send.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Conclusion</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Everyone&#8217;s inbox is filled up with business inquiries, newsletters, promotions, and not forgetting emails from good friends and families. </p>\n<p class=\"\">Write as if you are emailing a good friend and not as if you are addressing a faceless crowd. Be conversational. Respect everyone&#8217;s time because it&#8217;s precious to them.
