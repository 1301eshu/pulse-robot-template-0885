From written content to infographics to voice-overs and memes, we have seen it all. Nevertheless, the marketing trend that has evolved substantially over the years is video marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all started properly in the 90s with TV commercials with jingles. We have since seen 30-second quick ads, social media reels, TikTok videos, vlogs and Facebook live videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, we cannot imagine a <a href=\"https://api.growthnatives.com/blogs/marketing-automation/boost-your-marketing-strategy-with-marketing-automation-tools/\">marketing strategy</a> without some kind of video in the mix.

By tracking and analyzing these trends, businesses and marketers can gain a deeper understanding of their target audience and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.
